Hereâ€™s how it works. 6% on each transaction is split instantly among token holders and the burn wallet, reducing supply and rewarding holders. The Sheep Token protocol will burn 3% of every transaction forever and redistribute the remaining 3% to token holders as reward. This arrangement eradicates 3rd party risk from having to keep assets in a separate contract while yield farming while reducing supply.", "explorer": "https://bscscan.com/token/0x1b0a712f75a6dbb57e59e4b2513e627a28436dd6", "status": "active", "id": "0x1b0a712f75a6dbb57e59e4b2513e627a28436dd6"}
